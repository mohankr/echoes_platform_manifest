Echoes
======
This is my work in progress for pure builds of Google Android AOSP (as much as I can)


Gettings Started
----------------

To initialize you local repository using the Echoes fork. (Latest branch is lp-5.0)

$ repo init -u git://github.com/CyanogenMod/android.git -b lp-5.0

Now, you can sync (will take a long time):

$ repo sync
